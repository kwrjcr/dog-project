# Udacity Machine Learning Nandegree+ Dog Breed Classification Project
> This was a project that I was tasked with to learn more about deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  This project had me preprocessing the data and going through an exercise in order to check the accuracy of a plain old vanilla CNN.   I then had to use transfer learning from a well defined dataset in order to more accurately determine breed.  

## Installation
> This project required the use of numpy, pandas, scipy, sci-kit learn, keras, and tensorflow.
